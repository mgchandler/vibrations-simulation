# vibration-system

This repository contains code for the demonstration of physical vibration systems under various conditions. 

The home directory contains two files of interest: the script `vibrations.py` which contains the simulation model and an interactive GUI, and the Jupyter notebook `Vibrations Simulation.ipynb` which walks through the simulation and instatiates the GUI.

This project is implemented in Python, using the `ipywidgets` module to create an interactive code to visualise the vibrating system, which is acheived using `matplotlib`. The module `sympy` is used to represent the vibrating system as an expression.
