    "# Vibrations Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a demonstration of physical vibrating systems under various conditions. It was developed for use with the Vibrations component of the Dynamics and Control unit at the University of Bristol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vibration simulated here considers three components: the spring force, the damping force, and the external load. The user is encouraged to adjust the parameters of each of these forces, as well as the initial conditions, to investigate the impact it has on the resulting vibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is entirely contained within the accompanying script `vibrations.py`, which must be found in the same directory as this notebook."

    "The external forces available are described below:\n",
    "- Free Vibration\n",
    "  - There is no external force applied, i.e. $F = 0$.\n",
    "- Constant Force\n",
    "  - A constant force $F_0$ is activated after a delay of time $t_0$.\n",
    "- Sinusoidal\n",
    "  - An oscillating force $F = F_0 \\sin(2 \\pi f_{F0} t)$ with amplitude $F_0$ and frequency $f_{F0}$.\n",

    "#### Spring forces\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Three damping forces are available and are described below:\n",
    "- Linear Viscous\n",
    "  - Viscosity which is proportional to velocity $F = cv$, where $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ with damping constant $c$.\n",
    "- Friction (tanh)\n",
    "  - Hyperbolic tangent model of friction $F = F_f \\tanh(\\alpha v)$, where $F_f = |m g \\mu|$ and $\\alpha = \\tan^{-1}(F_r) / V_r$, with $F_r$ the portion of $F_f$ to be reached in $V_r$, and $V_r$ the velocity required to reach $F_f$ **(check w/ RH)**.\n",
    "- Friction (sqrt)\n",
    "  - Square root model of friction $F = \\frac{F_f v}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^2 + v^2}}$, where $F_f = |m g \\mu|$ and $\\epsilon$ is some sort of error? **(RH)**"
